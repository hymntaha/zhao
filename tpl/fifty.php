<h1>50% Profit Sharing</h1>

<p>
We will pay everyday experts 50% of future ad profit from their BYC stories that are exported and sold within Microguides on Amazon Kindle, Apple iBooks and the upcoming BYC Mobile App. We will also pay you 50% of the profit from your stories if third party publishers buy the rights to republish your work on separate channels.
</p>

<p>
Our social mission is to create jobs and grow a community of readers who can connect with local contributors in a globally far-reaching way. This will help create viable freelance jobs around the world.
</p>

<p>
Our artistic mission is to create an all-inclusive magazine platform to publish stories from professionals and everyday experts seamlessly. Writers and photographers use BYC to produce content about the spirit of their cities and neighborhoods - anything that matters to them.
