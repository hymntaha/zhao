        <h1>What is Bravo Your City?</h1>

        <div class="section-body">

          <p>
            Bravo Your City is a marketplace for stories to get published and discovered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Submit original, authentic stories about the spirit of your city: the food, people, fashion,  community, nature,
            or anything that excites you. Build up a portfolio of writing and get discovered by like-minded readers and publishers
            who come to BYC to browse, read, and <a href="/static/fifty">buy</a> stories about your city and travels. 
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also write about yourself or your business: Are you in a band with gigs this month? Does your restaurant have a
            special cocktail menu? Share some "insider" information, and build your brand!
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are a publisher interested in purchasing the rights to republish BYC stories, please inquire <a href="mailto:info@bravoyourcity.com">here</a>.

        <div class="section-body">
          <p>
            Step 1. Create a story with 1-5 photos and 1-500 words.
          </p>

          <p>
            Step 2. Submit it to Bravo Your City editors, who will accept or decline your story. 
            They may edit grammar and spelling, but they try to retain your voice and style.
          </p>

          <p>
            Step 3. Accepted stories are published on our homepage and can be curated into Microguides.
